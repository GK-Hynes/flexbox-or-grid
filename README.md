# Flexbox or CSS Grid

Examples comparing when to use Flexbox or CSS Grid (from Wes Bos' [CSS Grid course](https://cssgrid.io/)).

Flexbox is sometimes described as being for one dimensional layouts, while Grid is for multidimensional layouts, but things are more complicated than that.

Grid can do almost everything Flexbox can. Grid is also more consistent across browsers.

One advantage of Flexbox is that its values, such as flex-grow, can be transitioned.
